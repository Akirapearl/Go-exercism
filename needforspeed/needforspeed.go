drive one more time the car will not move:

4. Check if a remote controlled car can finish a race

To finish a race, a car has to be able to drive the race's distance. This means not draining its battery
 before having crossed the finish line. Implement the CanFinish function that takes a Car and a Track
 instance as its parameter and returns true if the car can finish the race; otherwise, return false.

Assume that you are currently at the starting line of the race and start the engine of the car for the race.
Take into account that the car's battery might not necessarily be fully charged when starting the race:

	batteryDrain := 2

	fmt.Println("CaracterÃ­sticas de tu bolido: ", car)

	distance := 100
	track := NewTrack(distance)
	fmt.Println("Tu pista mide (en metros)", track.distance)

	speed = 150
	batteryDrain = 5
