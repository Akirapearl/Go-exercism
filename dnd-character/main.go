/*
	Each player starts by generating a character they can play with.
	This character has, among other things, six abilities;
	[...]
	These six abilities have scores that are determined randomly...by rolling four
	6-sided dice and recording the sum of the largest three dice.

	You do this six times, once for each ability.

	Your character's initial hitpoints are 10 + your character's constitution
	modifier. You find your character's constitution modifier by subtracting 10
	from your character's constitution, divide by 2 and round down.
